# Esoteric Programming - JSFuck
> An esoteric programming language (esolang) is a programming language basically not designed for productive use. These languages are made just to explore ideas, for fun, for added challenge, or as a joke. Examples of esoteric languages are Befunge, Binary Lambda Calculus, Brainfuck, Chef, Fractan, Jsfuck, Shakesphere and many other more. For demonstration purposes, we will be focusing on JSfuck and explain what this is and how this differs from other esolanguages.

>JavaScript is weird. "3"+ 4 is 34, 5 + true is 6. Many js users consider this as unacceptable but some don't. Infact, they take advantage of these eccentricities to understand JavaScriptâ€™s type system more. Hence, JSFuck is introduced.
>JSFuck is an esoteric subset of JavaScript using only six characters in the source code namely, "[ , ] , ( , ) , ! , and +". It is derived from Brainfuck but unlike it which requires its own compiler, JSFuck is a valid JavaScript code meaning JSFuck programs can be run in any web browser or engine that interprets JavaScript. 

>JSFuck introduces itself with the following basics:
* false => ![]
* true => !![]
* undefined => [][[]]
* NaN => +[![]]
* 0 => +[]
* 1 => +!+[]
* 2 => !+[]+!+[]
* 10 => [+!+[]]+[+[]]
* Array => []
* Number => +[]
* String => []+[]
* Boolean => ![]
